FEND Arcade Game
=================

#### The Play

The game is at [this link](https://shamicker.github.io/FEND-Arcade-game/). There, you'll move the keyboard's arrow keys to move around the board. Good luck!

#### The Goal

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water, the player is moved to the bottom of the screen (on the grass) and play continues. Try to beat your best score!
